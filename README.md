# Kinephone

We can experiment with rhythms on the virtual model of the shape display. Example code can be found at public/examples/rhythms.js
* [CooperForm] (http://xiaosquared.com/formation/cooperform.html) (24 x 24)
* [TransForm] (http://xiaosquared.com/formation/transform.html) (3 islands of 16 x 24)

You can also run the virtual shape display from your own computer. In a terminal:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/XDXDXDXDXDXD/kinephone.git && cd kinephone
npm install
npm start
```
In a browser, go to localhost:3000/c or localhost:3000/t

Keyboard controls:
* _Ctrm-m_: opens and closes the browser
* _Enter_: run the current script
* _Space_: pause
* _d_: clear

You can also add more functionality to the underlying javascript if you clone your own copy. If you plan to do that, please make a new branch in the repo.
